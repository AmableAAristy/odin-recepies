    <h2>You will need the following.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>About 1 1/2 pints</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy whip cream</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>2/3 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 tea spoon fine sea salt</li>
        <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>This are the following steps for the formula.</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small pot, simmer heavy cream, milk, sugar and salt 
            until sugar completely dissolves, about 5 minutes. Remove 
            pot from heat. In a separate bowl, whisk yolks. Whisking 
            constantly, slowly whisk about a third of the hot cream 
            into the yolks, then whisk the yolk mixture back into the
             pot with the cream. Return pot to medium-low heat and 
             gently cook until mixture is thick enough to coat the 
             back of a spoon (about 170 degrees on an instant-read thermometer).</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
            Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Cool mixture to room temperature.
             Cover and chill at least 4 hours or overnight. Churn in an ice cream machine 
             according to manufacturers’ instructions. Serve directly from the machine for 
             soft serve, or store in freezer until needed.
